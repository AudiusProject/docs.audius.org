# Hedgehog

Build DApps Like Apps

[Github](https://github.com/AudiusProject/hedgehog) ðŸ‘ˆ  
  
Hedgehog is an open-source, client-side Ethereum wallet that uses a username and password. It aims to lower the barrier of entry to crypto projects for non tech-savvy users.

Allow users to interact with your DApp just like they would any other website, no extensions required, without centralizing control of keys.

**Hedgehog** is alternative to Metamask that manages a user's private key and wallet on the browser. It exposes a simple API to allow you to create an authentication scheme to let users sign up and login to their wallet across multiple browsers and devices.

### Not All Transactions Are Created Equal

Current Ethereum wallets treat every transaction as if it were moving your lifeâ€™s savings. Hedgehog was built for use-cases involving low-to-no financial value.

> Note: The primary improvement to end-user experience is gained by hiding wallet complexity and not forcing users to confirm transactions - the opposite of what youâ€™d want when moving significant money around.

#### No More Popups ðŸ¦Š

Decentralized apps today require lots of technical knowledge to configure and use, limiting your user base and reducing the potential for growth.

### Installation

```bash
npm i --save @audius/hedgehog
```

### Why Use This?

#### Not All Transactions Are Created Equal

Currently available wallets treat every transaction as if it were moving around your lifeâ€™s savings. Hedgehog was built for use-cases involving low-to-no financial value.

**NOTE**: The primary improvement to end-user experience is by hiding wallet complexity and not forcing users to constantly confirm transactions - The opposite of what youâ€™d want when moving significant money around.

#### Is Hedgehog Right for your DApp?

Hedgehog isnâ€™t right for every DApp. Massive improvements in user experience are only possible through tradeoffs. As a general rule Hedgehog should not be used for apps involving significant sums of money. As a bridge, one could start users on Hedgehog and suggest migrating to a more secure wallet if their stored value increases beyond a certain threshold; the Hedgehog paradigm is interoperable with existing web3 providers too.

_\[Good use cases\]_

* **Signing data**: If youâ€™re building decentralized applications that rely on user signed data \(eg. via EIP-712-esque signing schemes\), Hedgehog could help simplify the experience if the stakes are low enough.
* **Gaming DApp**: Nothing ruins fun as much as signing transactions. If youâ€™re building a gaming DApp that doesnâ€™t use significant financial assets, improving UX is key.
* **Decentralized Music Player**: If youâ€™re building consumer-facing DApps, Hedgehog will dramatically improve user experience and significantly increase your potential userbase.

_\[Bad use cases\]_

If your DApp involves moving around significant sums of money, then the tradeoff in security is most likely not worth it. Hedgehogâ€™s primary improvement to end-user experience is by hiding the wallet and not forcing users to confirm transactions - The opposite of what youâ€™d want when moving money around. We absolutely donâ€™t recommend using Hedgehog in situations like these:

* **Banking DApp**
* **Decentralized Lending**
* **Prediction Markets**

### A Closer Look

Hedgehog is a package that lives in your front end application to create and manage a user's entropy \(from which a private key is derived\). Hedgehog relies on a username and password to create auth artifacts, so it's able to simulate a familiar authentication system that allows users to sign up or login from multiple browsers or devices and retrieve their entropy. Those artifacts, through hedgehog, are persisted to a backend of your choosing.

**NOTE**: A private key is only computed and available client side and is never transmitted or stored anywhere besides the user's browser.

```javascript
// Provide getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn as requests to your database/backend service (more details in docs).
const hedgehog = new Hedgehog(getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn)
let wallet
if (hedgehog.isLoggedIn()) {
  wallet = hedgehog.getWallet()
} else {
  wallet = await hedgehog.login('username', 'password')
  // or
  wallet = await hedgehog.signUp('username', 'password')
}
```

After creating or retrieving a user's wallet, you can either **fund their wallet directly** to pay transaction fees or **relay their transactions through a EIP-712 relayer**.
