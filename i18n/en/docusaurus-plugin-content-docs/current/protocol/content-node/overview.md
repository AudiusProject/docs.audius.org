# Overview

An Audius Content Node is a service that stores and maintains the availability of all content across the Audius network.
Content types include user, track, and playlist metadata, images and artwork, and audio content.

[github repository](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/master/creator-node)
[registered discovery nodes](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/services/content-node)

Design Goals

1. Surface the Audius Storage Protocol for storing and serving images and audio
2. Keep data consistently replicated and available
3. Provide an interface to handle content upload, transcoding, and identification
4. Allow users to maintain agency over where and how their data is stored amongst Content Nodes

:::note

The Content Node may be referred to as the Creator Node. These services are the same.
